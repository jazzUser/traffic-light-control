Project: Traffic Light Control System
Description: Developed a traffic light control system using Java and JPanel, featuring three vehicle traffic lights and two pedestrian traffic lights.
Functionality: Ensures that a new traffic light cycle starts only after the previous cycle has fully completed, preventing process overlap.
